# Aurora Parts Comparator (Backend MVP)

**Goal:** Provide a search API that returns parts with Domestic vs Non-Domestic labels so FE can build UI now.

## Endpoints (target for this week)
- `GET /health` â†’ `{ "ok": true }`
- `GET /search?q=<text>&page=1&page_size=20`

## Run (to be filled as we scaffold)
1) Node 20+, Git, VS Code
2) MySQL via Docker or PlanetScale/Railway
